### Hello World!

My name is Valentina Valverde and I am currently a Design Engineer at Chipp AI. I'm a Carolina Code School and Develop Carolina alumni and have been on this journey for almost 2 years now.

This is my 2025 portfolio. I thought I would make myself a cool new one by my 20th birthday, so here we are! Thanks for being here!
